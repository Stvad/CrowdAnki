    # We want to make sure that we're testing pure python dulwich,
    # since that's what the users will be using.
    #
    # We only want to install dulwich via the `-r requirements.txt`
    # method, since the presence of any non-default option causes pip
    # to avoid using wheels for all the other dependencies, which
    # slows down the build considerably (and breaks it on Windows).  I
    # don't think that any of our other current dependencies might
    # potentially use binary wheels, so in this case using wheels is
    # probably safe.  (Besides, AFAIK we didn't have any issues
    # specifically caused by a dependency other than dulwich (see
    # #138, so testing the other dependencies isn't a focus.)
    #
    # Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get process substitution
    # (`<()`) to work, within GitHub actions, so I'm writing
    # requirements.txt to a file.
