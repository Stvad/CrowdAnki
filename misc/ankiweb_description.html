Starting with version 0.6 it also features a close integration with Git.
Providing you with an ability to <b>automatically maintain history of edits</b> for your decks.

<b>Suggested collaboration workflow (a more detailed version is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>):</b>

The current workflow could be described as following:
<ul>
<li>The user creates or imports a deck inside of Anki.</li>
<li>Makes some modification to it (i.e. to notes, deck settings, deck structure or note models).</li>
<li>Then the user can export the deck in JSON format (accompanied by media directory with media files used in that deck) and share it with other users. For example by creating GitHub repo with it.</li>
<li>Other people then can either modify JSON directly or import the deck to their instance of Anki and then make some modifications to it.</li>
<li>Original JSON then can be updated the with the changes, these people made (merging several changes together if necessary).</li>
<li>After that original user (and other people) can import updated deck to integrate these new changes into their collection.</li>
</ul>

<b>Export</b>
To perform the export go to menu <code>File&gt;Export</code>
Select the deck (note: export of "All decks" is not supported, you need to select a specific deck) and the export format "CrowdAnki JSON representation". After pressing the Export button - select directory where the result should be stored.

<b>Import</b>
To perform the import go to menu <code>File&gt;CrowdAnki: Import from
    disk</code> and select the directory where the deck is stored.

<b>Import from GitHub</b>

To get the deck from GitHub go to menu File&gt;"CrowdAnki: Import from GitHub" and enter GitHub username and repository name in suggested format.
So, for example, to get my git deck (<a href="https://github.com/Stvad/Software_Engineering__git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Stvad/Software_Engineering__git</a>) you would need to enter Stvad/Software_Engineering__git.

<b>Things to note for the Import:</b>
<ul>
<li>Automatic backup would be triggered prior to the import;</li>
<li>If note model for the note has changed, or if note model itself changed in a way that it's not easy to update it automatically: you would be prompted with the window, that will ask you to specify correspondence between old and new model;</li>
<li>If the note was moved to another deck in JSON file, on import all cards from that note (except the ones, that are in dynamic decks) will be moved to the specified deck.</li>
</ul>

<b><a href="#snapshots" id="snapshots">Snapshots</a></b>
<b>CrowdAnki</b> can help you preserve <strong>the history of edits for your decks</strong>.
It does this by exporting them in a specified location and creating a git commit each time you do a snapshot.
You can take snapshots manually via <code>File &gt; CrowdAnki: Snapshot</code> menu action.
Or you can enable automated snapshots in add-on configuration (see below) which will take a snapshot each time you open or close anki.

<b><a href="#configsettings" id="configsettings">Configuration Settings</a></b>
You can find the add-on's config page via <code>Tools -> Add-ons, select CrowdAnki then hit Config</code>.
In here you can set a some config options, as well as a detailed explanation on what each does, with examples and default behaviour.

Here is a general summary of the currently available config options:
 - <code>Snapshot Path</code>: location of the snapshot will be exported to
 - <code>Snapshot Root Decks</code>: when a snapshot is taken a git repo will be generated for each of these decks
 - <code>Automated Snapshot</code>: whether the snapshot happens automatically
 - <code>Do Not Move Existing Cards on Import</code>: whether to move already existing cards on import or not
 - <code>Deck Sort Methods</code>: how to sort cards on export
 - <code>Reverse Sort Order</code>: whether to reverse the sorting of cards on export
